        My name is Andrew Kassel, I am currently a student at Syracuse University studying Information Management and Technology through the iSchool. Technology is something that I have been interested in all of my life, and this passion has led me to do things such as building computers and experimenting with all kinds of devices and tech. Some skills I have in this field are problem solving, collaboration experience, project planning/management, and communication. Outside of my major, I have other interests with a few being reading books, traveling, exploring cultures, watching TV shows and movies, and spending time with family and friends. I'm extremely open to new experiences, and I'm always looking for new things to try.
