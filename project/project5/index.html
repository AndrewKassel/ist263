            <h1>Why You Should Visit</h1>
            <p>
               The Outer Banks would be most enjoyed by families and people who like to go to the beach to relax and take it easy. Some places in OBX are more laid-back than others, with each town having their own specialty. Duck has unique shops, incredible food, and the most activity since that’s where everyone enters the island. Corolla, which is north of Duck, has a different feel, with more nature and even a 4x4 secton where you can drive on the beach and see wildlife roaming around. Kity Hawk is south of Duck, and consists of some great history, like where the first plane was flown. So, no matter where you are in OBX, there is something unique to experience. Did I menton that there is only one main road on the thin island? So don’t worry about getting lost, its only north or south!
